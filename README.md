# Covid-Data-Analysis
Project done for 'data analysis' course of Electrical and Computer Engineering department AUTH (2022)

Ex1: Distribution of positivity rates for Europe. Fit into known distributions
Ex2: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on positivity rate distributions of different time intervals (Bootstrap calculation of the statistic)
Ex3: Comparing Greek positivity rates to European positivity rates for a 12-week period. (using bootstrap and a=5%)
Ex4: Using parametric and bootstrap test to find out if the positivity rates changed significantly in 2021 compared to 2020.(in 5 countries)
Ex5: Parametric and bootstrap significance test of correlation coefficients for positivity rates in pairs of countries. 
Ex6: Bootstrap test the equivalence of the correlation coefficients for two pairs of countries.
Ex7: Try and compare regression models that predict deaths based on positivity rates in the previous weeks.
Ex8: Using positivity rates of previous days to predict deaths in Greece and apply PCA to reduce feature dimensions.
Ex9: Using 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the model of Ex8.
Ex10: Using number of tubed patients in previous days to predict deaths. (With PCA)
